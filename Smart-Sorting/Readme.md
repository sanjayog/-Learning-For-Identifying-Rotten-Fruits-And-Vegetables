My project is about Smart Sorting to transfer learning for identifying rotten fruits and vegetables

**Project Description:**
 
 ->Smart Sorting is a deep learning-based web application that uses Transfer Learning to identify whether fruits and vegetables are Healthy or Rotten.
 This solution improves sorting accuracy and reduces food waste in agriculture, supermarkets, and households.

**Key Features:**
There are some key features for sorting the rotten from fresh iteams based of fruits and vegitables.
1.Upload fruit or vegetable images.
2.Predict the class using a trained CNN model (based on VGG16).
3.Show whether it's Good to Eat or Not.
4.Displays Prediction Confidence and Result Message.
5.Feedback for impressive or problem after the prediction 

**Dataset:**
Dataset is used for for train and validation.
-> There are 29 Classes basis on (Healthy/Rotten pairs for 14 fruits/vegetables).
-> Total 29,000 images i have downloaded the dataset from kaggle.com.
-> As well as i have Split into: 80% Training and 20% Validation.

**Technologies Used:**
Based on the Smart Sorting project i have used some technologies like:
1. Python 3.9
2. TensorFlow / Keras
3. Flask
4. HTML5 + CSS3 (internal)
5. Jupyter Notebook
6. PIL, NumPy, OS

**Installation:**
Based on the project I have installed the Anaconda Navigator to run my code through Jupyter notebook

**Install dependencies:** -> pip install -r requirements.txt

**Run Flask App:** ->python app.py
